## !splits <comparison\>

Gives the final time for the currently active splits in LiveSplit, for the given comparison. Use the following shorthands for the <comparison\> argument:
+ pb (Personal Best)
+ best (Best Segments)
+ bestsplits (Best Split Times)
+ average (Average Segments)
+ median (Median Segments)
+ worst (Worst Segments)
+ balanced (Balanced PB)
+ latest (Latest Run)
and one useless one that will go unnamed. (can you guess what it is?)

For example, type "!splits pb" to get my personal best.

Troubleshooting:
+ "X is not a shorthand for any known comparison." --- You may have a typo in the shorthand for the comparison you want to see.
+ "The X comparison is not currently active." --- I haven't activated this comparison in my LiveSplit settings. Sorry.
+ "LiveSplit Server isn't running at the moment." --- I either don't have LiveSplit open, or I forgot to start the LiveSplit Server component. The latter is an error on my part, the former probably isn't. Please discern before complaining.

## !spotify <command\>

There are a couple options for the "command" argument currently:
+ current --- Get the name of the currently playing track.
+ previous --- Get the name of the previously played track.

Note that if you have significant delay or use one of these commands right as the track is changing, the answer you get might be incorrect. There's also a minor quirk where Spotify doesn't save recently played track info if the track is a local file on my computer. If the track name that it gives seems incorrect, don't hesitate to ask me about it and I'll try to give you the right answer.
